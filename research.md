My current research focuses on optimality criteria and policy optimization
in reinforcement learning.
More specifically, I study [Veinott](https://web.stanford.edu/group/msande-history/cgi-bin/mw/index.php/Arthur_F._Veinott,_Jr.)'s discounting-free optimality criteria
to approximately achieve [Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell)'s optimal policies.
This is mainly under the supervision of [Marcus Gallagher](https://marcusgal.github.io/).

My publications can be found in
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/dewanto_v_1.html),
[dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/180/6982.html), and
[SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Vektor-Dewanto/3408231).
All of them are joint works with my bright collaborators.
