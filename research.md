My current research focuses on optimality criteria and policy optimization
in reinforcement learning.
More specifically, I study [Veinott's discounting-free optimality criteria](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-40/issue-5/Discrete-Dynamic-Programming-with-Sensitive-Discount-Optimality-Criteria/10.1214/aoms/1177697379.full)
to approximately achieve [Blackwell's optimal policies](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-33/issue-2/Discrete-Dynamic-Programming/10.1214/aoms/1177704593.full).
This is mainly under the supervision of [Marcus Gallagher](https://marcusgal.github.io/).

My publications can be found in
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/dewanto_v_1.html),
[dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/180/6982.html), and
[SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Vektor-Dewanto/3408231).
All of them are joint works with my bright collaborators.
