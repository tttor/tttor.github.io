My current research focuses on optimality criteria and policy optimalizatin
in reinforcement learning.
More specifically, I study [Veinott](https://web.stanford.edu/group/msande-history/cgi-bin/mw/index.php/Arthur_F._Veinott,_Jr.)'s discounting-free optimality criteria
to approximately achieve [Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blackwell)'s optimal policies.
