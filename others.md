I am originally from [Kutoarjo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutoarjo,_Purworejo),
where we speak [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language).
I am luckily married to Ekaputri.
We are raising our first optimal son, Euclid.

I also study Islam, see [my note](https://github.com/tttor/islam).

For other stuff, I maintain this [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vektorDewanto).
