Greetings! I am Vektor. <br />
I make autonomous robots **fully** autonomous.

I strongly believe that reinforcement learning (RL) is one _key_ element of _fully_ autonomous robots. <br />
Here, I refer to _both_ model-free _and_ model-based RL, where the latter consists of model learning and planning.

I am a PhD student in the [Robot Design Lab](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au), [School of ITEE](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/), [Univ. of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/). <br />
My _dear_ supervisor is [Hanna Kurniawati](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:welcome).
