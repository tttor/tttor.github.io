Greetings! I am Vektor. <br />
I make autonomous robots _progressively more_ autonomous.

I believe that reinforcement learning (RL) is one _key_ element of _progressively more_ autonomous robots. <br />
Here, I refer to RL that is hierarchical, bayesian, deep, actor-critic, dyna (=modelFree + modelBased), ... :) <br />
For some foundation, please see [my note](https://github.com/tttor/rl-foundation).

I am a PhD student at the [Robot Design Lab](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au), [School of ITEE](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/), [Univ. of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/). <br />
I am supervised by 
[Hanna Kurniawati](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:welcome) and
[Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/). <br />
For now, I am interested in _planning with a learned model_.

I graduated in
computational intelligence (m.eng) from the Dept of Computational Intelligence (now part of [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04.html)), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/) and 
electrical eng (control eng, b.eng) from the [Dept of Electrical Eng](http://www.ee.ui.ac.id), [Univ. of Indonesia](http://www.ui.ac.id/en/).
I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of [JASSO](http://www.jasso.go.jp/en/), [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/), and [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/).

I am originally from [Kutoarjo](https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-3713855&fid=2393&c=indonesia). <br />
I proudly speak [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language) and [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language) as my native languages.
I also speak English and (struggle for) [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic).
