Welcome. I am Vektor. <br />
I study how to make autonomous robots _progressively more_ autonomous. <br />

I am a PhD student at the [School of ITEE](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/), 
[Univ. of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/). <br />
I am supervised by 
[Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/), 
[Marcus Gallagher](http://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/marcusg/index.html), and
[Ali Eshragh](http://www.alieshragh.info/).<br />
These days, I am excited about _policy optimization in reinforcement learning_.

I studied control in the [Dept of Electrical Eng](http://www.ee.ui.ac.id), [Univ. of Indonesia](http://www.ui.ac.id/en/) and
computational intelligence in the [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04.html), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/).
I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of [JASSO](http://www.jasso.go.jp/en/), [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/), [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/), and of course, my parents.
