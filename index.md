Greetings! I am Vektor. <br />
I make autonomous robots _progressively more_ autonomous. <br />
I believe that one key element is reinforcement learning that is hierarchical, bayesian, deep, actor-critic, Dyna-like, ... :) <br />

I am a PhD student at the [Robot Design Lab](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au), [School of ITEE](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/), [Univ. of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/). <br />
I am supervised by 
[Hanna Kurniawati](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:welcome) and
[Fred Roosta](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/FredRoosta/). <br />
For now, I am interested in _planning with a learned model_.

I graduated in
computational intelligence (m.eng) from the Dept of Computational Intelligence (now part of [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04.html)), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/) and 
electrical eng (control eng, b.eng) from the [Dept of Electrical Eng](http://www.ee.ui.ac.id), [Univ. of Indonesia](http://www.ui.ac.id/en/).
I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of [JASSO](http://www.jasso.go.jp/en/), [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/), and [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/).
