Welcome.

I am interested in control and reinforcement learning to make robots progressively more autonomous.
I also like teaching as a way to participate in building the future.

See my [research](https://tttor.github.io/research.html), [teaching](https://tttor.github.io/teach.html), and [other](https://tttor.github.io/others.html) stuff.
I also maintain this [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/tttorrr/likes).
