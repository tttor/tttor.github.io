Greetings! I am Vektor. <br />
I make autonomous robots _fully_ autonomous.

I _deeply_ believe that Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) is one _key_ element of _fully_ autonomous robots. <br />
Here, I refer to the _integrated_ model-free _and_ model-based RL, where the latter consists of (model)learning and planning. <br />
Sequential decision making under uncertainty is one of fundamental challenges in artificial intelligence.

I am a PhD student in the [Robot Design Lab](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au), [School of ITEE](http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/), [Univ. of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/). <br />
My _dear_ supervisor is [Hanna Kurniawati](http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~hannakur/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:welcome). <br />
I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UQ.

I graduated in electrical eng (control stream, bachelor) from the [Dept of Electrical Eng](http://www.ee.ui.ac.id), [University of Indonesia](http://www.ui.ac.id/en/) and <br />
in computational intelligence (master) from the Dept of Computational Intelligence (now part of [School of Computing](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04.html)), [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/).

I am originally from [Kutoarjo](https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-3713855&fid=2393&c=indonesia). <br />
I proudly speak [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language) and [Indonesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language) as my native languages.
I also speak English and (struggle for) [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic).
